The Software Build Framework based on GNU make
==============================================

It makes a shift in thinking of Makefiles as specifying what to build rather
then how to build. How-to-build part is also present, of course. However, this
information is separated into config files, loaded right after gmake
invocation. There's no need to repeated it or in any way reference in
individual GMakefiles in a source hierarchy.

Another prominent feature is that directories are not changed during the build
process while allowing hierarchal source tree traversal and softwre rebuild in
individual project directories. All paths are built dynamically on invocation
for the whole project, relative to the current directory at the moment. It has
the following benefits among many others:

- Speeding up of the build process as no changing directories takes place

- Better dependency awareness even between sibling directories so figuring out
  what code shell be rebuilt is more precise

- All diagnostic and error messages about files being rebuilt are relative to
  the current directory, so they may be used to fire an editor session
  automatically.

The framework relies on several presumption about the project development tree
structure:

- The source tree top is called 'src'

- Binaries will be placed into a parallel hierachy starting from the directory
  'bin' on the same level as 'src'

- Project libraries will be located in directory 'lib' under 'src' or one
  level below 'src', library header files will be located in the corresponding
  directory in a parallel include hierarchy, starting from directory 'include'
  on the same level as 'lib'.

- Every directory starting from 'src' has file GMakefile that in the very
  least specify what sub-directories to include in the build process.

- Every directory in the build proces must be mentioned in its parent
  directory's GMakefile.

NOTE: GNU make version 3.80 or higher required.  Earlier versions will not
work as the framework makes heavy use of 'eval' function and recursive
variable expansion, that became available only since the specified version.

Please read also comments in the beginning of the scripts/gmake file. It is a
Ruby script.
